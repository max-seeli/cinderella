# Infinite-state reachability games

This repository contains the artifact for the paper "Automated Approach for Solving Infinite-state Polynomial Reachability Games" and contains the tools and benchmarks used in the experiments.

## Overview
The tool is contained in the `src/cinderella` directory in the `witness.py` file. Within this directory, you will also find utility scripts, that are used by the main tool and the benchmarks. The benchmarks (i.e. differnt versions of the games) are located in the `src/cinderella/benchmarks` directory. 

In the `other_benchmarks` directory, you will find the same benchmarks in a different format, suited for other tools. They are used to compare the performance of our tool with other tools.

The `configs` directory contains configuration for the underlying solver [PolyQent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03796), which is used to solve the constraint systems.

Finally, in the `out` directory, the `.smt2` files will be stored that are generated by the tool and given to PolyQent for solving. 

## How to run the tool
We use the UV python package manager. To setup the project, install UV on your system, by following the instructions at https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/. After installing UV, you can run the benchmarks using the provided `run_all.sh` script.

You can also run individual benchmarks by running their specification file:
```
uv run src/cinderella/benchmarks/benchmark_name.py
```
